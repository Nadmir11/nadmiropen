      <h3><!-- EDIT HERE: Player 1 Name -->Daniel H Rim</h3>
      <p><!-- EDIT HERE: Player 1 Bio -->Starting golf at a late age of 28, "Dan Woo Lee" was able to defy all odds to became a professional golfer in under a year winning all 4 Majors and the JDC on his first year on the PGA tour. He promptly retired after, shocking and upsetting millions around the world. Now back from retirement, can he prove that he's still world #1? </p>

      <p><!-- EDIT HERE: Player 2 Bio -->As a true man of wisdom, "David Homa" was the first of his peers to pick up the mighty iron to play a round of golf. As such, his golf game exhibits tremendous experience, displaying an incredible amount of skill only few could achieve in a lifetime. 4x Master, 2x US Open, 3x PGA Champtioship, 4x The Open Championships, and 1x John Doe Championship Winner, all while high on his own company's fentanyl.

      <h3><!-- EDIT HERE: Player 2 Name -->John Kim</h3>
      <p><!-- EDIT HERE: Player 2 Bio -->He may be the youngest competitor in the field, but don't be fooled, "John Rahm" has it all. Globally known as the golf protigy since age 3, he hes somehow exceeded all expectations. 9x Master, 7x US Open, 8x PGA Champtioship, 6x The Open Championships, and 1x Roger Cup Winner, all before retiring to become a physical therapist at age 14. Does the young wizard still have his magic or will he crumble under the pressure as he did in the JDC?</p>

      <h3><!-- EDIT HERE: Player 2 Name -->Roger Kim</h3>
      <p><!-- EDIT HERE: Player 2 Bio -->Escaping from the deep jungles of North Korea to find freedom in the United States, "Roger Matsuyama" used golf as a means of therapy to recover from his PTSD. Others quickly realized that he was given an extraodinary gift and urged him to compete on the PGA Tour. He quickly found fame and success and enjoyed the riches of his new career, however few could predict what would happened next. Roger's Meth and Cratom addiction was too much to overcome and he was stripped of his PGA Tour card. With something to prove, can Roger find redemption on and off the golf course?</p>
