    <h3><!-- EDIT HERE: Name -->Daniel H Rim</h3>
    <p><!-- EDIT HERE: Bio -->Starting golf at a late age of 28, "Dan Woo Lee" was able to defy all odds to became a professional golfer in under a year winning all 4 Majors and the JDC on his first year on the PGA tour. He promptly retired after, shocking and upsetting millions around the world. Now back from retirement, can he silence the haters and show that he isn't a one year wonder?</p>

    <h3><!-- EDIT HERE: Name -->David Kim</h3>
    <p><!-- EDIT HERE: Bio -->As a true man of wisdom, David "Tom" Kim was the first of his peers to pick up the mighty iron to play a round of golf. As a seasoned veteran, his golf game exhibits tremendous experience, displaying an incredible amount of skill only few could achieve in a lifetime. Winning every tournaments was easy, and David was riding the highs of golf and life. However those were not the only highs David was riding. Suffering from addiction, David struggled to stay away from Fentanyl and was caught abusing the substance at work. Now trying to move on from this incident, can David stay sober for the most important week of his life?</p>

    <h3><!-- EDIT HERE: Name -->John Kim</h3>
    <p><!-- EDIT HERE: Bio -->He may be the youngest competitor in the field, but don't be fooled, "John Rahm" has it all. Globally recognized as a golf protigy since age 3, he has exceeded all expectations and lived out his golf career to the highest potential. 9x Master, 7x US Open, 8x PGA Championship, 6x The Open Championship, and 1x Roger Cup Winner, all accomplished before age 26 where he then chose a different career path to become a physical therapist. However recent allegations of innapropriate behavior during physical therapy sessions have left his job in jeopardy. As his funds run low due to the ongoing lawsuit, John Rahm makes a return to the game he once loved to secure a check and his place in golf history. Does the young wizard have enough magic to cash in or will he post himself on Craig's List in the coming months?</p>

    <h3><!-- EDIT HERE: Name -->Roger Kim</h3>
    <p><!-- EDIT HERE: Bio -->Escaping from the treacherous work camps of North Korea to find freedom in the United States, "Roger Matsuyama" initially used golf as a means of therapy to recover from his PTSD. Others quickly realized that he was given an extraodinary gift and urged him to compete on the PGA Tour. He quickly found fame and success and enjoyed the riches of his new career, however few could predict what would happened next. Roger's Meth and Kratom addiction was too much to overcome and he was stripped of his PGA Tour card. With something to prove, can Roger find redemption on and off the golf course?</p>
